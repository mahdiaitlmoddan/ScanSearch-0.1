# ScanSearch

ScanSearch is a powerful file management tool built with PyQt6. It simplifies the task of finding files across your entire system by scanning all drives and collecting essential information about each file, such as its name, path, size, type, and creation and modification dates. This data is then stored in an SQLite database for quick retrieval, making file searches faster and more efficient.

The true power of ScanSearch lies in its ability to help you locate files across various drives. If you've ever struggled to remember where you stored a particular file, ScanSearch is the solution you've been looking for. It eliminates the need to manually check each drive, saving you precious time and effort.

Furthermore, the intuitive GUI presents all the collected data in a neatly organized table. The user-friendly interface allows you to search for files by name and sort the table based on different attributes, giving you total control over your file data.

In short, ScanSearch offers a unique combination of thorough file scanning and user-friendly presentation. Its efficiency, speed, and ease of use make it an indispensable tool for anyone seeking to improve their file management system. Whether you're a casual computer user or a professional dealing with extensive file databases, ScanSearch has the capabilities to enhance your workflow and productivity.
