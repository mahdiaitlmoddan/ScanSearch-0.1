# ScanSearch
ScanSearch is a PyQt6-based file scanning application that traverses all drives on the system and collects information about each file, such as its name, path, size, type, date created, and date modified. This information is stored in an SQLite database and displayed in a table in the GUI. ScanSearch also includes the ability to search for files by name and sort the table by different attributes.
